Marine Compass
====================

A fully web standards compliant JavaScript 3D Compass application.

#### Requirements ####

A web browser with the following web standards support:

* WebGL - [When/Where can I use WebGL?](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl)
* Device Orientation Events - [When/Where can I use Device Orientation Events?](http://caniuse.com/#feat=deviceorientation)

As of 23-Jul 2012 only [Opera Mobile 12 for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.browser&hl=en) has the necessary web standards support required to run this application. You can view the shiny effects in [Google Chrome for Mac](http://www.google.com/mac/) but the lack of a device orientation 'alpha' value means that the compass cannot be calibrated correctly.

#### Usage ####

Simply clone this repo as follows:

    git clone git@github.com:richtr/Marine-Compass.git

Load 'index.html' and enjoy!
